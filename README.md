Lousson: Message
================

NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS A WORKING DRAFT !!

The `Lousson_Message` package provides various facilities to communicate
between processes, network nodes and applications in both, synchroneous
and asynchroneous fashion.


Dependencies
------------

The `Lousson_Message` package itself depends on PHP and a(ny) PSR-0
compatible autoload implementation:

- **PHP 5.3.0+**:                           http://www.php.net/
- **PSR-0 Autoloader**:                     http://pear.phix-project.org/
- **Lousson_Exception 0.2.2+**:             http://pear.lousson.org/
- **Lousson_Record 0.4.0+**:                http://pear.lousson.org/
- **Lousson_URI 0.4.2+**:                   http://pear.lousson.org/

However, there is also a bunch of tools the development and build
processes rely on, e.g.:

- **Git 1.7+**:                             http://www.git-scm.com/
- **Phing 2.4+**:                           http://www.phing.info/
- **Phix 0.15.0+**:                         http://www.phix-project.org/
- **PHPUnit 3.7+**:                         http://www.phpunit.de/
- **Pirum 1.1.4+**:                         http://pirum.sensiolabs.org/
