/**
 *  An interface for message provider
 *
 *  The Lousson\Message\AnyMessageProvider interface declares an API for
 *  message provider implementations in general.
 *
 *  Message providers are data sources to access messages with a pull API
 *  (rather than message handlers, which expect to get the data pushed to
 *  them). They also implement a reporting mechanism to flag messages as
 *  acknowledged or discarded, which allows e.g. an implementation-specific
 *  error handling to restore status or report back to another entity.
